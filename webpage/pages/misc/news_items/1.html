		<p>It’s been almost a year, but Symthic is back with a fancy new domain.  What you will find is a more refined symthic.com, hosting the same data straight from the game files as we have always done.  Please take a look around the site, and if you have any questions or feedback, let us know via the Sym Discord.</p>
		<p>So, what is next for sym.gg?  Although we have launched with <i>Battlefield V</i> (with a light offering of <i>Battlefield 1</i>), refinement of the <i>Battlefield</i> pages will be an ongoing process, due to both user feedback and <i>Battlefield V</i>’s own Tides of War progression, which will be adding new items to the game for the foreseeable future.  Expect to see previous other <i>Battlefield</i> titles reappear on the site over time as well.</p>
		<p>Outside of <i>Battlefield,</i> we are currently working on data for Apex Legends, a popular battle royale FPS set in the <i>Titanfall</i> universe.  Additionally, thanks to a poll that many individuals completed, we know that current interests for Sym going forward lie in the <i>Call of Duty, Rainbow Six, SW:Battlefront,</i> and <i>Titanfall</i> franchises.  However, time and experience are limiting factors, and we cannot accomplish everything we would like to in a brief period of time.  Therefore, we are happy to announce that sym.gg will become an open-source endeavor, so if you or anyone you know has experience extracting data from these franchises, and would also be willing to help add these titles to sym.gg, please get in contact with us!</p>	
		<p>On behalf of all the site’s staff, we hope you enjoy the new sym.gg!</p>
