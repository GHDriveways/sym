       	  <li>The player health is 100. In hardcore the default is 60.000004.
		  Player can still be alive with 0% health as the health shown in UI (or calculated<br>
		  in assists) is rounded so they actually can have in example 0.3 healthpoints left.<br><br>
		  Player's health and bullet damage may be different on custom preset servers.<BR>
		  Admins can change the `BULLET DAMAGE MODIFIER IN %´ and `PLAYER HEALTH IN %´.<BR></li>
		  
		  <li>Standing on health kit gives you 10 hp/sec.</li>
		  <li>Without health kit the regenartion rate is 5 hp/sec.</li>
		  <li>You start recovering health 16 seconds after taking damage.</li>
		  <li>If you run into a health kit range and then run out of its range before you have full hp,
		  it will always take 12 seconds to start normal 5hp/sec regeneration again.</li>
