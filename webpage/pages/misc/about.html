	<h2>History</h2>
		<p>The original symthic.com was founded in November 2011.  Before that, Symthic was simply the owner's online handle, and the website was his private website meant for his friends and personal projects.  However when he got his hands on Battlefield 3's data and published the first weapon charts on the public part of the website, it got a new meaning in a few days. Other things moved and Symthic soon became a BF3 weapon stats-website.<br>
		<br>This first website was very basic and poorly polished, featuring simple BF3 damage chart-images and other general information.  It was hosted on Sym's old broken laptop from his home and worked behind the url symthic.dy.fi.  It didn't take long for the traffic outgrow the laptop's abilities, so Symthic was moved to a real webhost and obtained the domain symthic.com.  <i>That's</i> how Symthic was born.<br>
		<br>A few weeks later, the Symthic forum was created and it quickly became the place for BF3 data enthusiasts.  Then during the summer of 2013, Symthic was sold to Curse Inc., but nothing changed development-wise.  Multiple games were published on the site, such as BF4, BFH, BF1, CoD: Ghosts, Titanfall, and SW:BF.<br>
		<br>In January of 2019, the original symthic.com was archived, and all development ceased.  However work transitioned to sym.gg after purchasing the domain, and the first true version of the new site went live in September 2019 thanks to the hard work of a few developers!

	<h2>Achievements</h2>
		<p>Historiacally, Sym has most of its legacy with the Battlefield franchise, and as such there have been many collaborations between the Sym community and DICE developers to further improve the state of the game.  In the past we've received pre-patch files from the DICE to analyze and give feedback on before the patch was rolled out live, and have on other occasions provided unified feedback regarding weapon balance for multiple titles.<br>
		<br>While one may think the Sym community consists of largely number-crunchers, Sym has also maintained a competitive Battlefield team to great success, coming out on top in many events ranging from 5v5 gamemodes, to 10v10 Conquest, all the way up to 32v32 clan wars duriing BF3 and BF4's lifespans.  The list of victories is long, and the stories behind them are ones for the books.
