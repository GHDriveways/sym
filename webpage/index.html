                    <div>Sym is the premier website fro you to find weapon and statistical data for the most popular games, extracted straight from the gamefiles themselves.  Consisting of a community that love being gaming scientists, typical discussion consists of saying things like, "up to 11.525 meters that weapon will 1 hit kill with a headshot" as opposed to "yeah that gun feels good - nahh that one doesn't."</div>
                    <div>It is the community's goal to nitpick and examine every single statistic to see exactly how you can overcome it and what it will do to your performance.</div>
