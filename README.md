# Sym
Towards more open-source Symthic/Sym pages ( https://sym.gg/ )

Your one-place-stop for insight on game mechanics. Successor to https://symthic.com .

## Guidelines

* Javascript should be written according to [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/)
* For HTML5 follow [W3School's HTML5 style guide](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp)
* Git commit messages should be done in [imperative commit-style](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3580764/2867076).
* Site should be light on the server, thus things should be done on Javascript. Server just serves
  static files, javascripts and any databases in JSON files.

## Design principles

Each section of page has independent code, i.e. no sharing of code between games. This results to code
duplication and some difficulties in mantaining, but this is done as games can have small or large
differences in their mechanics, even across titles from same series (e.g. Battlefield 1 vs. Battlefield V)
